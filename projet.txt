Dear Ladies, 

Following this workshop, and to further improve your skills, you are requested to complete a small task in teams.

But first, I would appreciate your valuable feedback on https://goo.gl/forms/GD4mlPsFVnq6KpWB3 so I can improve future workshops to meet your needs.

 

The task:

Description: 
Given how Git is used for teamwork and better collaboration, we will emphasis on those skills.
You are asked to create a public project on GitHub with the code of your choice. (You will need to sign-up)
Attached you can find an image of the expected git commit tree.
Expected Outcome:
The idea is having a master branch from which 2 features branches will start (feature-1 and feature-2) at the same step.
Each feature will be working on specific changes on the same files. 
While merging, you will encounter merge conflicts (ex: changes in feature-1 of same line changed in feature-2) that you will be asked to solve to complete a successful merge.
Tagging specific commits with its appropriate version (v0.7, v1.0 …) is also needed.
In the end, one member of your team will fork the repository, make changes and send a pull request that you will accept and merge with the master branch.
Results:
The steps taken should be briefly described and presented along with your results by email [with the team members in CC].
Due Date:
Morning of Wednesday June 20.
 
the workshop will be held at the same location : 2nd floor
 

If you encounter any problem, don’t hesitate to contact me and do not forget to bring your laptop 


Best Regards,
Jean-Marc
